# Temp-Logistics
Temp-Logistics benchmarks Random Forest, LSTM and GRU models to forecast future temperature trends using historical Detroit weather data (2014–2023). This project compares classical ML vs deep learning for time-series forecasting and highlights how temperature prediction can support logistics and supply chain decision-making.
